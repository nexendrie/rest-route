A new version of Rest route is out.

The package was adopted by Nexendrie Project as it was unmaintained for years and it is needed by the project. In the process, the package was renamed to nexendrie/rest-route and namespace was changed to changed namespace to Nexendrie\RestRoute.

It adds support for PHP 8 but removes support for PHP 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3. The code was updated to made use of some new features which might have caused a few BC breaks.

Http method HEAD is now supported, it calls read/readAll action (just like GET method).

For complete list of changes since previous version, see CHANGELOG.md.
